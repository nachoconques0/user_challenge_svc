thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on this challenge, to write some code again. It's been a few months since I last touched code after leaving my previous job, so this project was not only a technical challenge for me but also some kind of personal. I might be a bit rusty lol.I've spent the entire weekend working on it and it helped me get back into the zone

If you come across any weird or crazy things in the code, im sorry I will fix it XD

Thanks again for your time and consideration üôè
